    description:
      "Hair bonding uses medicated tape and glue, which are skin-friendly, to fix the hair patch. Made with 100% natural human hair, the patch can be styled and colored to your preference. Monthly studio visits are required for routine service, which includes cleaning old tape and glue, oiling, head massage, washing, cutting, hair spa, replacing old tape, and applying new glue, all at a nominal charge.",

    title: "HAIR CLIPPING",
    description:
      "The second technique is called hair clipping. In this process we use special hair clips which are principally made for hair patches. The hair clip is stitched inside ones hair system and is attached with ones hair. Under this process we donâ€™t need to shave your hairs its attached through the help of clips. This fixture is very easy to wear and can be removed only if one is willing to remove it.",

    title: "HAIR TAPPING",
    description:
      "Hair tapping, similar to hair bonding but without applying glue on your head. Only medicated tape is used, making it ideal for those who prefer weekly services. Both hair fixing and hair clipping techniques give the same look, but hair clipping can be removed daily as it is attached with clips. Hair fixing cannot be removed by oneself and requires monthly studio visits. Both techniques are more economical than surgery.",
