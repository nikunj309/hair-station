                Clip base hair extensions, also known as clip-in hair
                extensions, come in individual strands or specific shaped pieces
                attached at the base with fabric or silicone. Clips are attached
                to this base and come ready to use. Each clip snaps open and
                closes with ease. They are the best permanent style of extensions
                because you can quickly remove them and put them back on whenever
                you want.

                <strong>HOW LONG DO THEY LAST?</strong> Once again, this depends
                on how well you take care of them, what products you use, and
                how often you wear them. With proper care and regular wear,
                clip-ins last anywhere from 3 â€“ 6 months, up to a year, and
                sometimes even longer.
